## Introduction
### Transpile or compile
<p>
transpileing is compiling to another structure/language at the same level of abstraction

* Suprise areas 
    * Prototypal inheritance
        * Typescript solves problems by Adding classes, namespaces, modules, and interfaces

    * Equality and type juggling

        * TypeScript intrudeces type checking

    * Management of modules
        * TypeScript makes module loaders the default way of working
    * Scope
        * let and const variable declarations eliminate confusion cause by variable hosting, omission ofthe "var" keyword 
    * Lack of types
        * Development tools have difficulty providing anything beyond a reasonable guess as to variable type. TypeScript formalizes type information
* Tools
    * Gulp and Grunt are workflow tools
* Alternatives
    * Babel
        * no compile time checking 
    * Coffee Script
        * no static type checking 
        * top three of the "Most Dreaded Languages"
